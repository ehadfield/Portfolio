## Known Bugs

_3/22/19: Due to how I chose to link my projects on the page, there's no visual cue for the user to know there's a link there. Hence why I added a note saying to click on the project to see github. This is likely because I chose for the column to be the link itself rather than text. However I also didn't make the column a button nor did I add a button. I'd like for the column itself to act like a button without looking like a button.This would likely involve some sort of hover reaction. I'm looking into it..._
